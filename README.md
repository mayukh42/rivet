# Rivet

A simple Dependency Injection library in Java. 

Beans are defined in an XML confg file, which is read into a list of bean definitions using xparse (https://github.com/mayukh42/xparse) XML parser. As of version 0.17.6, one annotation '@Riveted' is supported to automatically inject fields in a bean from available beans. 


[TODO: Expand the README to include use cases. ]
